/**
 * v1.4.39.2 — dashboard analytics slim/thick split.
 *
 * Pre-fix the dashboard fired a single `useAnalyticsQuery()` against the
 * thick `/api/analytics` envelope; every per-type tile waited on the
 * heavy fan-out before paint. Mood and medication tiles arrived first
 * (separate routes) and then every other tile arrived as one burst,
 * which the maintainer reported as "etwas nervig" in the v1.4.39.1 post-deploy
 * trace.
 *
 * Post-fix the dashboard mounts TWO `useAnalyticsQuery` calls in
 * parallel: one for `?slice=summaries` (per-type tile strip) and one
 * for the thick envelope (BD-Zielbereich + glucose tiles). The tile
 * strip paints from the slim slice as soon as it lands; thick fields
 * stream in afterwards. Without this dual-mount the cold-mount UX
 * waterfall regresses to the v1.4.39.1 behaviour, so the test pins the
 * two call shapes.
 *
 * v1.7.0 — both calls now carry an `enabled` gate so the unified
 * snapshot rollout flag can disable them in favour of a single
 * `/api/dashboard/snapshot` cell. With the flag OFF (default) the
 * slim/thick split still drives the page, so the protective intent
 * holds; the matchers only relaxed to tolerate the `enabled` arg.
