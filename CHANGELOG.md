# Changelog

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Compose env-var validation no longer breaks Coolify-style deploys.**
  `docker-compose.yml` previously used `${VAR:?required}` shell-parameter
  syntax for the four secrets and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Some hosting
  platforms (Coolify in particular) parse compose files eagerly and
  store the _fallback error string_ (`"POSTGRES_PASSWORD is required"`)
  as the literal env-var value when `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` was unset,
  which then collided with `DATABASE_URL` and broke the running app
  with `P1000: Authentication failed`. Compose now uses plain `${VAR}`
  interpolation; validation moved into `docker-entrypoint.sh`, which
  fails fast with a clear stderr message listing the unset variables.

### Notes

If you upgraded an existing Compose stack from 1.2.x → 1.3.0 and hit
the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD is required` literal-as-value bug, set
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your environment to whatever your existing
Postgres data volume was originally initialised with (likely
`healthlog` if you started from a pre-1.2.1 release), then redeploy.
Postgres only honours `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` on first volume init — the
existing user keeps the original password regardless of env changes.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added — Body composition + targeted hardening

- **Total body water and bone mass as measurement types** (closes #89). New
  enum values `TOTAL_BODY_WATER` and `BONE_MASS`, both stored canonically
  in kilograms (matches Withings hydration/bone-mass measures and Health
  Connect's `TotalBodyWaterRecord` / `BoneMassRecord`). Migration is
  purely additive (`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`) — safe to apply against
  any 1.2.x database without downtime.
- **Withings sync picks both up automatically.** The Withings client now
  maps measure type `77` (hydration / water mass) and `88` (bone mass).
  Anyone with a Withings Body+ scale and an active connection will see
  the new metrics flowing in on the next sync without any extra config.
- **Doctor-report PDF includes both new types** in the vital-signs table
  when data exists, with locale-aware labels in English and German.
- **Dashboard widgets registered for both** (default-invisible — opt in
  via Settings → Dashboard layout).

### Security

- **SSRF guard hardened** (`isPublicUrl`). The previous implementation
  used `parseInt` with permissive prefix checks like `h.startsWith("10.")`
  which let `010.0.0.1` slip through — and worse, the WHATWG URL parser
  silently normalises `010.0.0.1` to `8.0.0.1` (octal interpretation), a
  real bypass on naive checks. The new guard adds a pre-URL leading-zero
  check on the raw input, a strict IPv4 parser, and proper IPv6
  bracket / loopback / link-local handling. Now blocks `127.0.0.0/8`,
  `0.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`,
  `192.168.0.0/16`, `100.64.0.0/10` (CGNAT), `::1`, `fe80::/10`,
  `fc00::/7`. Comprehensive regression tests included.
- **GitHub PAT redacted from logged error bodies.** When a feedback
  escalation to GitHub fails, the response body was being passed
  verbatim into `getEvent()?.addWarning(...)` — flowing to Loki. The
  body is now stripped of the configured token before logging.
- **Per-user threshold writes are rate-limited** (30 writes / 5 min) to
  make audit-log enumeration unattractive. Audit-logging itself was
  already there.

### Performance

- **N+1 in `/api/insights/comprehensive` fixed.** The medication-compliance
  loop hit Postgres once per active medication. It now batches into a
  single `medicationId IN (...)` query and groups in memory. Latency
  improvement scales linearly with the user's active medication count.

### Reliability

- **pg-boss draining on SIGTERM/SIGINT.** `docker stop`, Coolify redeploys,
  and Kubernetes pod terminations now trigger `boss.stop({ graceful: true,
timeout: 30s })` so in-flight handlers finish instead of being killed.
  Previously, pending handlers could be lost or replayed on restart.
- **CI now blocks on TypeScript strict checks.** `continue-on-error: true`
  removed for typecheck. Tests already were blocking. ESLint stays
  non-blocking for now — the existing `settings/page.tsx` monolith has
  long-standing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` violations whose proper
  fix lives in the 1.4.0 settings-split refactor; a blocking lint here
  would just gate every PR until that refactor lands. Required cleaning
  up two `any` types in `api-handler.ts` (justified inline — Next.js
  variadic handler signature constrained by `Promise<Response>` return).

### Polish

- **Bottom-nav touch targets** sized to WCAG 2.5.5 minimum (44×44 CSS px).
  Visual icon stays at 20 px so the design doesn't shift.
- **Phase-config dialog** marks the decorative coloured dot `aria-hidden`
  because the redundant text label already conveys the phase to screen
  readers. No more meaningless `image` node announcements.
- **Admin-status labels** for "Web Push" and "Bug Report" now go through
  `t()` (new `admin.integrationWebPush` / `admin.integrationBugReport`
  keys in en + de). They were the last hard-coded English strings on
  the admin page.

### What's _not_ in this release (tracked for later)

- **Onboarding redesign** (dashboard-first empty-state flow + persistent
  Getting Started checklist) and the **typed `apiClient` wrapper** that
  underpins it are tracked for a focused 1.4.0 cycle. The 1.2.1 patch
  already closed the acute symptoms of #87 (silent-failure toast +
  default schedule), so the redesign is now a proper UI investment
  rather than a bug-fix.
- **Withings sync is mapping both new measures**, but **a dedicated
  Bearer-auth ingest endpoint for external pipelines** (n8n + Health
  Connect, requested in #89) ships in 1.4.0 alongside the API-token
  flow.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Onboarding**: Medications added during onboarding are now actually persisted (closes #87). The wizard previously sent an empty `schedules: []` array, the server-side validation rejected it with a 422, the client never checked `response.ok`, and the user was redirected to the dashboard as if everything had worked. Onboarding now wraps each step in `try/catch`, surfaces failures via toast, and attaches a default reminder window (`08:00–09:00 daily`) so the medication actually persists. A hint under the medication list explains the default.
- **Docker setup** (closes #88):
  - `docker-compose.yml` now uses `ports: "3000:3000"` (was `expose: "3000"`, which made the app unreachable from the host).
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is a single env var that both the Postgres service and `DATABASE_URL` interpolate, so they cannot drift apart.
  - `.env.example` now points at the in-container hostname `db:5432` (was `localhost:5432`, which never resolves inside the app container).
- **Documentation**:
  - `package.json` synced to 1.2.0 (was lagging on 1.1.0).
  - `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` corrected to 23 models (the `Feedback` model added in v1.2 was missing from the count).
  - `README.md` Quick Start gives a realistic time estimate, generates the four secrets in one block straight into `.env`, and points reverse-proxy users at the docs.

### Added — Tooling & Supply Chain

- **Pre-built multi-arch images on GHCR**: `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` now builds `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` images on every push to `main` and on every `v*` tag, publishing to `ghcr.io/mbombeck/healthlog`. Self-hosters no longer need a build toolchain — `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` is enough. The bundled `docker-compose.yml` references the published image with a `build:` block as fallback for contributors.
- **Supply-chain attestations**: each published image carries a SLSA build provenance statement and a Software Bill of Materials. `SECURITY.md` documents how to verify them and how to pin a specific version.
- **Documentation single source of truth**: `getting-started/installation.mdx` is now the canonical setup guide (mirrors the bundled `docker-compose.yml`); `self-hosting/docker.mdx` slimmed to image internals + ops notes only. The landing page's Quick Start terminal block now includes the secrets-generation step (was missing).

### Notes

This is a patch release that closes the install/onboarding friction reported in #87 and #88. The bigger user-facing changes (additional measurement types like total body water and bone mass per #89, full onboarding redesign, typed API client) are tracked for `1.3.0`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added — Personalization, Glucose & Multi-Provider AI

- **Per-user custom thresholds**: Override the computed default ranges (BP, BMI, glucose, pulse) with values from your clinician. Audit-logged with previous/new values and timestamps. Doctor Report PDF flags custom ranges and prints both your target and the standard guideline value.
- **Blood glucose tracking**: New metric with `fasting`, `postprandial`, `random`, and `bedtime` contexts. Display unit switch between mg/dL and mmol/L (lossless conversion). Context-aware classification per ADA 2024 / DGIM. Per-context charting on dashboard and Doctor Report PDF.
- **Dashboard customization**: Show/hide and drag-to-reorder every dashboard widget. Per-user preference, reset-to-defaults button. Layout persists across the same user on the same device.
- **Built-in feedback system**: New in-app Send Feedback flow (Bug / Feature / Question / Other) with anonymized system info attachment. Stored in HealthLog's own database — no GitHub config required. Optional `Escalate to GitHub` button for admins who configure a PAT.
- **Multi-provider AI insights**: Provider abstraction extended with **Anthropic Claude** and **local OpenAI-compatible endpoints** (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM) alongside OpenAI. Per-user provider selection. Local endpoints keep all health data on your network.
- **Locale-aware UI polish (English-first)**: Numbers, dates, glucose units, BP, weight, and BMI all formatted via `useFormatters()` from the active locale. Doctor Report PDF and AI insight prompts now respect locale end-to-end (no hand-rolled `Intl.*` with fixed locales).

### Changed

- Reference range computation extracted into a dedicated `src/lib/health/thresholds.ts` module with computed defaults and override resolution.
- AI provider routing reworked to dispatch by `provider` field on the user record; OpenAI remains the default for legacy users.
- Dashboard route renders widgets from `UserDashboardLayout` model when present, otherwise falls back to the default order.
- Doctor Report PDF: locale-aware headers, glucose section, custom-range badges.

### Security

- GitHub PAT for feedback escalation stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in the database (never as env var).
- Local AI endpoint URLs validated against SSRF (no localhost/RFC1918 unless explicitly allowed by admin).
- Custom threshold writes rate-limited and audit-logged with IP.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — AI Insights Overhaul

- **Provider Abstraction**: New `src/lib/ai/` module with pluggable providers (Codex OAuth, Admin Key, None) and automatic failover
- **Medical Insight Prompts**: 7 specialized prompts based on ESC/ESH 2023, WHO, DGE, and DEGAM guidelines
  - Blood Pressure: ESC/ESH classification, morning risk ladder (J-HOP), pulse pressure, seasonal variation
  - Weight: 5%/10% milestone recognition, plateau detection, body composition divergence
  - Pulse: Fitness interpretation ladder, 80-100 bpm elevated-risk band, rate-pressure product
  - BMI: Age-adjusted DEGAM classification for 65+
  - Medication Compliance: Chronotherapy hints, mood-adherence risk prediction, 90-day tracking
  - General Status: Cross-domain synthesis with cardiovascular risk stratification
  - Mood: Bidirectional correlations with vitals and adherence
- **Enriched Feature Extraction**:
  - Sleep duration and activity steps (previously ignored)
  - Rate-Pressure Product (pulse × systolic BP, myocardial demand indicator)
  - Body composition divergence flag (weight stable + body fat rising)
  - Mood-adherence risk predictor
  - Seasonal BP variation (winter vs summer, requires >180 days data)
  - BP standard deviation (sdSys30/sdDia30) as variability risk marker
  - Pulse pressure (arterial stiffness marker)
  - 5 cross-metric Pearson correlations (weight↔BP, pulse↔BP, mood↔pulse, mood↔BP, mood↔weight)
  - 90-day averages and all-time statistics for all metrics
  - Historical comparison (current 7d vs previous 30d baseline)
- **New UI Components**:
  - `InsightStatusCard`: Compact per-metric status card with classification indicator and fade-in animation
  - `InsightAdvisorCard`: Premium structured card with findings, correlations, recommendations (ready for integration)
- **OAuth Routes**: `/api/auth/codex/authorize`, `/callback`, `/disconnect` for ChatGPT connection
- **Admin AI Settings**: `/api/admin/ai-settings` for global API key management

### Changed

- Insight prompts now use personal advisor tone ("dein Blutdruck") with positive-first pattern
- Reasoning scaffold in system prompt (What changed? → Why? → What to do?)
- Conditional correlation instructions (only mention when |r| > 0.4)
- InsightResult schema enriched with `insightType`, `primaryRecommendation`, `classificationLabel`
- BP target calculation now uses paired readings (both sys AND dia must be in range simultaneously)
- Medication streak tracking extended from 7-day to 30-day window
- CSP updated to allow `chatgpt.com` for OAuth flow

### Security

- Rate limiting on all OAuth and admin endpoints
- PKCE (S256) + state parameter for OAuth CSRF protection
- Encrypted token storage at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Error messages truncated to prevent upstream response body leaks
- Admin key preview shows last 4 chars of decrypted key (not ciphertext prefix)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for insight card animations

### Removed

- `openaiKeyEncrypted` field from User model (replaced by provider abstraction)
- Direct OpenAI API calls from insight generators (now routed through provider)
- Legacy API key input in settings UI (replaced by ChatGPT connect button)
